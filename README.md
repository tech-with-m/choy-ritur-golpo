## üåü Overview

Bangla Weather is a mobile application designed to provide accessible weather information for disaster-prone coastal communities in Bangladesh. Built with Flutter, this app prioritizes simplicity, cultural appropriateness, and offline functionality to serve marginalized communities facing annual cyclones and extreme weather events.

### Key Features

- **üå§Ô∏è Weather Data**: Current conditions and forecasts for Bangladesh
- **üáßüá© Bangla Language Interface**: UI primarily in Bengali for local accessibility
- **üì± Offline-First Design**: Works without internet connection using cached data
- **üö® Disaster Alerts**: Push notifications for weather warnings and emergencies
- **üå∏ Cultural Seasons Tab**: Information about Bangladesh's six seasons with traditional context

## üéØ Research Background

### Problem Statement

Bangladesh ranks among the world's most climate-vulnerable nations. The 2023 Cyclone Mocha affected over 1.5 million people, yet existing weather apps fail coastal communities. During field visits, I observed that despite widespread smartphone ownership, residents struggled with English-language apps using technical terminology like "precipitation probability"‚Äîmeaningless to farmers and fishermen whose livelihoods depend on weather conditions.

### Participatory Design Approach

Before development, I consulted 12 professionals (2023 - 2025): disaster management officials, first responders, and local technology practitioners. Key insights revealed:

- **Trust matters more than accuracy**: Local figures are trusted over government apps
- **Language barriers exclude users**: Technical terms and English interfaces prevent access
- **Connectivity fails when needed most**: Mobile signals disappear during storms

### Impact

- **Positive user reception** with high ratings on Play Store
- **Active usage** across Bangladesh and neighboring regions
- **Community adoption** demonstrating need for Bangla-language weather tools

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Flutter SDK** (3.7.2 or later) - [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- **Android Studio** or **VS Code** with Flutter extensions
- **Git** for version control
- **Android device** or **emulator** for testing

### Installation Guide

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tech-with-m/choy-ritur-golpo.git
cd choy-ritur-golpo
```

#### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

#### Step 3: Firebase Setup (Required for Push Notifications)

1. **Create a Firebase Project**:
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Click "Create a project" and follow the setup wizard
   - Enable Google Analytics (optional)

2. **Add Android App**:
   - Click "Add app" and select Android
   - Use package name: `com.tech_with_m.choy_ritur_golpo`
   - Download `google-services.json`
   - Place the file in `android/app/` directory

3. **Enable Services**:
   - Go to Project Settings ‚Üí Cloud Messaging
   - Enable Cloud Messaging
   - Note down your Server Key (for sending notifications)

#### Step 4: Configure App Signing (For Release Builds)

1. **Create a keystore** (if you don't have one):
   ```bash
   keytool -genkey -v -keystore android/app/choy_ritur_golpo.keystore -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias choy_ritur_golpo
   ```

2. **Create key.properties file**:
   Create `android/key.properties` with your keystore details:
   ```properties
   storePassword=your_store_password
   keyPassword=your_key_password
   keyAlias=choy_ritur_golpo
   storeFile=choy_ritur_golpo.keystore
   ```

#### Step 5: Run the App

```bash
# For debug mode
flutter run

# For release mode (requires keystore setup)
flutter run --release
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup for Beginners

#### If you're new to Flutter:

1. **Install Flutter**:
   - Download from [flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
   - Add Flutter to your PATH
   - Run `flutter doctor` to check installation

2. **Install Android Studio**:
   - Download from [developer.android.com](https://developer.android.com/studio)
   - Install Android SDK and emulator
   - Install Flutter and Dart plugins

3. **Verify Setup**:
   ```bash
   flutter doctor
   ```
   Ensure all checkmarks are green.

#### Common Issues and Solutions:

- **"Flutter command not found"**: Add Flutter to your system PATH
- **"No connected devices"**: Start an Android emulator or connect a physical device
- **"Gradle build failed"**: Clean and rebuild: `flutter clean && flutter pub get`

curl -X POST -H "Authorization: key=YOUR_SERVER_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "to": "/topics/alert",
       "notification": {
         "title": "‡¶ù‡¶°‡¶º‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶∏‡¶§‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶ï‡¶§‡¶æ",
